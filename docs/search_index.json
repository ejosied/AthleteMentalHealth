Our curiosity began with inquiries of how mental health varies within different catagories of sports: performative vs. competitive, team vs. individual, elite vs. amateur. correlated with mental health outcomes. It became our task to find data that spanned a variety of sports and offered several insights into mental health across a somewhat consistent population. In searching for datasets that had relevant information and data points, we found this 2006 survey data of 795 Northeastern students that targeted athletes and non-athletes. The data includes survey results on “how or if participation in sports affects their health-risk behavior”. Based on the data collected, we altered our questions and scope accordingly, and ultimately decided to fovcus on answering the following questions: 1.1 How are identification with sports and mental health correlated? How are perceived performance and mental health correlated? Example: How do mental health results correspond to the different responses to survey questions like “I am the best”? How are perceived ambition and mental health correlated? Example: How do mental health results correspond to the different responses to survey questions like “I do my very best”? How do certain sports appear to be correlated with self-destructive/dangerous behaviors? Example: Is there a correlation between type of athelete and reports of behaviors like driving while drunk or high, or engaging in physical fights? 1.2 How are individual/community connection to sports and mental health correlated? How does the correlation differ between sports that are typically performed individually (example: golf, skiing), in small groups (example: tennis), or in larger teams (example: soccer)? 1.3 How are demographic information and mental health correlated for the student athletes? How do mental health responses differ between male and female athletes? What about between sports that are traditionally male- or female-dominated?

The data was collected as part of the study Academic Involvement Study (of Students in a Northeastern University in the United States), 2006. It was conducted by Kathleen Miller of the University of Buffalo. The study falls under ICPSR (Inter-University Consortium of Political and Social Research). Information was gathered on April 21st, 2006 in the form of a one-time (cross-sectional) questionnaire distributed and filled out on site using pen and paper. Participants were confirmed to be at least 18 years of age, and submitting a signed informed consent form with their survey responses. Participants were asked to be honest and accurate, and were assured that their personal information would be kept confidential. Careful instructions were provided throughout the questionnaire, including when to skip non-applicable questions. 3.2 Basic information about the dataset: The data includes responses to the questions presented in the questionnaire, which focus on “experiences, observations, and attitudes about athletic involvement as well as a variety of health-risk behaviors”. Som demographic information is also included, such as age, gender, ethnicity, and religion. Section 1: Demographic Background contains 17 questions about basic personal, academic, and family information. Section 2: Athletic and Physical Activities contains three separate lists–—one for each of high school and community sport participation during high shcool, and one for college and/or community sport participation in the past 12 months—of 22 sports with two ``other\" options and an option for no sports. There are also 6 questions about the frequency of sport participation. Section 3: Health Risk Behaviors contains 18 opportunities for responses about alcohol and drug use; 20 opportunities for responses about risk behaviors and sexual activity; 10 opportunities for responses about anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Section 4: Primary Sport History contains 31 opportunities for responses about the student’s primary sport involving participation, perception, and policies. Section 5: Personal Feelings About Athletic Involvement contains 25 questions to guage personal, physical and mental wellness, and social motivations for participating in sports. It also contains 22 questions about goals, perception of performance and motivation, and views on success. Section 6: Exercise and Sport-Related Identity contains 24 questions about personal relationship with sports and exercise. It also contained 54 questions about perceptions of “jocks” vs. “athletes”. Section 7: Attitudes contains 21 questions about romance and sexual activity, 23 auestions about winning and losing, and 18 questions about risky behaviors. The result is a data set with 795 observations representing the student participants, and 590 variables representing responses. There are more variables than questions asked because some questions had opportunities for multiple responses. 3.3 Issues/problems with the data: This will be updated as we work more with the data.

About 65% of rows contain no missing variables. For patterns 2, 4, 5 &amp; 7 - the pattern is fairly similar across and spans seemingly similar sets of variables. Patterns 3 &amp; 6 are also similar in the types of missing data. 5.3 A Deeper Look into the Missing Data To take a deeper look into the data that is missing, we took a look directly at the ‘missing’ areas that were shown above. For the purposes of analysis we also flipped the chart in order to better read the column headers that constitute these missing data patterns. Note that the chart now increases in frequency of ‘missing’ from left to right on the x-axis per pattern. 5.3.1 Observations: Based on inspection, we can see that the common questions of the questionnaire that have missing values are those in the following categories: MPSQ: Reasons for Participation in Sport CESD: Mental Health Assessment Section SRI: Sexual Activity Questions The two variables that are missing across 4 patterns each are: SRI02 - LAST TIME HAD SEX: USED OTHER BIRTH CONTROL PSME - RECEIVED MEDIA ATTENTION For patterns 3 and 6 the common areas of missing variables are from: CESD: the Mental Health Assessment section SRI: the Sexual Activity Section The variable missing most often is TEOSQ13. 5.3.1.1 Discussion It is understandable that some college students would prefer not to disclose their sexual behavior, so this pattern of missing values seems non-random. Mental health likewise is topic that is often glossed over, and given the survey was conducted in 2006 mental health was an even less discussed topic than it is today, it is not surprising that some of these questions were left unanswered by students. The MSPQ variables are part of the following question: “People have many different reasons for participating in sports. Below are listed some of those possible reasons. How important is each of these reasons for you?” and each variable accounts for a different answer to the question which the student could answer on a score from 1 to 5. A missing variable indicates that they did not answer the question at all. This could be because they do not participate in sports. Variable TEOSQ13 is a question within the “Feelings about Athletic Success” section where the question was: “People have different ideas about what athletic”success\" means, other than simply winning or losing a competition. Think about the times when you have felt most successful in sport. How well does each of the following statements describe your feelings? I feel most successful in sport when . . . I do my very best.\" There were 13 variations on this question that provided different answers to select from in the questionnaire and all 13 of the TEOSQ variables show up in the missing values top list. Similar to the MSPQ variables, the responses to the question was a score between 1 to 5. We believe that missing values to this question are also due to students who did not participate in sports. "],["results.html", "Chapter 6 Results 6.1 Who took this survey? 6.2 Investigating Mental Health Responses 6.3 Investigating Sport Motivation, Perspectives on Success, Behavior Patterns, and Mental Health for Athletes", " Chapter 6 Results 6.1 Who took this survey? Students who took part in this survey are within the age range of College Students as is expected. Some older students who participated in the study may include graduate students and some students who started college later than their peers or are taking extra time to finish. The breakdown between men and women is fairly evenly split, which is nice to see. The majority of respondents were white, which may lead to some biases in responses, particularly because mental health is known to have strong correlations with economic status and race. However, when you consider this is a survey given to students at Northeastern University, a private university in Boston, in 2006 it could be feasible that this breakdown represented the student population at that time, especially for athletes and those interested in sports. Lastly, we see from the demographics that we have a majority of underclassmen who took the survey (Freshman, Sophomore) which may also lead to biased results as the stresses of college, adult life, and a persons relationship to sport likely change between Freshman and Senior years of college. Now that we know a little bit about the demographics of respondents, lets take a look at what sports they participated in: Students selected a wide variety of sports as their Primary Sport. Each student was only able to elect one sport, however we are not displaying those who did not select any sport as we will only be looking at students with a primary sport. We can see that some sports had relatively low response rates and because of that we will exclude all Sports below (and including) ‘Other’ on this list. We see that the most popular sports are Basketball, Soccer, Football and Baseball. This makes sense for an American University! 6.2 Investigating Mental Health Responses Our primary questions of interest surround how aspects of sport, performance, and team correlate with Mental Health Indicators. As part of the survey given to students, there were 10 questions that were meant to assess each students mental health. Students were asked to respond to the following prompt: \"Below is a list of some of the ways you may have felt or behaved recently. Please indicate how often you have felt this way during the past week.\" Let’s take a look at how students responded to these questions: Add discussion of graph or graphs here. Transition to self made scores to see if MH correlates with any other behaviors 6.3 Investigating Sport Motivation, Perspectives on Success, Behavior Patterns, and Mental Health for Athletes In effort to assess how factors related to sports and sport performance are related to an athletes mental health, we created a scoring formula for all students based on their responses to the survey questions: Mental Health Score – Mental Health questions were posed in the following manner: \"Below is a list of some of the ways you may have felt or behaved recently. Please indicate how often you have felt this way during the past week.\" Based on the feeling, we assigned scores that were positive to indicate positive mental health outlook versus negative scores to indicate a negative outlook on mental health. For example, if a respondent answered “I was happy” with “All of the time” they would get +2 points, versus a response of “Rarely or None of the Time” would get -2 points. In summary, a high mental health score denotes a positive mental health outlook. Internal Motivation Score – Risk Averse Score – Success through Hardwork Score – We were interested in understanding how these indicators correlated with eachother and most importantly with mental health scores. Unfortunately, there seems to be only a loose correlation between Mental Health Scores and the various indicators. The strongest being a positive correlation (0.70) between mental health and motivation. The strongest correlation observed overall is between Motivation and Outlook on Success. Higher scores in these two categories mean motivation is mostly coming from within (versus external motivation) and that success comes from hardwork and training (versus pure skill or talent), respectively. This makes sense intuitively because if someone has internal motivation to do something, they likely use that motivation to work at whatever the skill or task is. 6.3.1 Health &amp; Life Outlook Scores by Sport Type In looking at this plot, there are many interesting things to note. We’ll talk about maximum values per Assessment first: Rugby has the highest average mental health score amongst all athletes and sports polled! After Rugby, Figure Skating, Equestrian, and Skiing are the next highest scorers respectively. Figure Skating has the highest score for internal motivation. However it is important to remember that Figure Skating had only one response, which is not a compelling amount of data for which we can say anything conclusive about the sport or the athletes within it. The second highest score for internal motivation is Gymnastics, closely followed by Skiing. Interestingly, these are all individual sports. Intuitively, this makes sense as people doing individual sports need to be heavily motivated in order to perform well in their respective sport. This is not to say team sport athletes are not motivated, however they could rely more on their teammates and thereby have more external motivation from the team, versus someone who is competing alone. Ping-Pong ranks as the most risk averse sport amongst athletes polled in this survey! The runners up were Rowing and Colorguard. Rowing has the highest success through hardwork score. In fact, all four of the categories are above average for Rowing. Gymnastics was second for success through hardwork, followed by Rugby. Based on the definition of the score, this would mean these three sports responded in the least ego-centric manner and attribute their success more to hardwork than pure talent and being “better” than their competitors. Some indicators that deserve deeper conversation: Colorguard is the only sport that has a negative mental health score. Colorguard is a team of performers who perform choreographed dances and routines with various equipment to the music of the marching band show. Although the sports are quite different, there are some parallels to be made between Colorguard and Dance, however their scores are quite different upon comparison! Dance has a below average success through hardwork score, but above average on all other assessments, while colorguard is well below average on mental health and above average on others. One thing that makes colorguard different than all other sports on this list is the fact that the colorguard is performing alongside another performance, that being the marching band, perhaps that has some effect on participants that is not exhibited in other sports. Badminton and Weightlifting are the only two sports that skewed more towards the ego side of outlook on their success than on hardwork. This is surprising for weightlifting because weightlifting is almost not at all related to athletic ability or “being good” at it, since you need to build muscle overtime in order to become proficient, however perhaps something about the culture of weightlifting propegates this mentality. The amount of pro-risky behavior sports was surprising to us as well. Based on previous knowledge and research, we anticipated that football, rugby, boxing, wrestling, and ice hockey would be on the riskier side due to the violent aspects of their sport and sport cultures however cross country, golf, and badminton were very unexpected additions to this list. Individual sports and Team sports don’t show trends between groups indicating there may be no correlation between these factors and the type of sport, team or individual, you are part of. So we wondered if perhaps grouping by gender would be a better indicator for any of these assessments. We hand selected sports that had representation across both genders (in addition we also added Baseball and Softball as comparable sports for male and female respectively). 6.3.2 Health &amp; Life Outlook Scores by Gender There is one assessment that clearly differs between men and women: risk tolerance! This graph is sorted in decreasing order by Risk Aversion scores in Sports (we are unsure why the Female facet is not in order by risk aversion - it does however matche the Male facet ordering besides the addition of Softball). For all sports that have male and female participants, the males are more risk tolerant than the females are. This outcome is not incredibly surprising, however it is interesting to see that no female sport averages fell into the negative area. The closest were female rugby players. Based on the nature of rugby, this seems reasonable. For some sports like soccer, females have a lower mental health score than males in their sport, however this is not consistent across all sports. When we compare basketball we see that female basketball players have a higher mental health score. So we cannot say that that one or the other gender has better or worse mental health outlooks. Because of the stark difference in male and females in sports like Rugby and Lacrosse we took a look at how they answered survey questions: 6.3.3 Health &amp; Life Outlook Scores by College Year Surprising to us was the fact that Freshman and Senior distributions did not actually differ that much. We had assumed that perhaps over the course of college the differnce between Freshman and Senior for attributes like Success Through Hardwork or Internal Motivation may have increased. This plot is sorted by Motivation, however there doesn’t seem to be clear distinction of upward progress between Freshman and Senior years. Important to note however is that these are not the same people in their Freshman and Senior years, but two different sets of people, so it could be that this group of Freshman is exceptionally mature and the Senior immature or simply that there is not as much of a measureable change visible in these years from this dataset. 6.3.4 Health &amp; Life Outlook Scores by Race An immediate finding is that the American Indian / Other respondents have multiple sports with significantly lower risk scores than their peers, meaning they are more risk tolerant and risk seeking.

The perceived intensity, physical and time demand, and competiveness may lead people to develop ideas about the sport that may or may not align with the athletes’ experiences. With this sequence of bar charts, you have the opportunity to see how well your perspective on certain sports matches that of the athletes who contributed their responses to our data. The survey responses considered here were those assessing whether a individual experiences joy or depression more frequenty, is more internally or externally motivated, and has a healthy or toxic view of success. The indidivuals were then assigned “points” in each catagory; points were awarded for responses indicating a healthy mindset, and deducted for responses indicating an unhealthy mindset. The point value was two when the individual felt strongly about their reponse, one when the individual felt moderately about their reponse, and zero when neutral if applicable. The classification of survey questions as being indicative of “positive” or “negative” mental health is somewhat subjective, but the point system gives an insight into the trends among athletes of a certain sport and allow for comparisons between sports. The classification of the questions and point value system may be viewed in more detail in the code of the “Results” section. 7.2 What next? These sport-by-sport comparisons give us quick tests of intuition, but by engaging with the interaction for a longer amount of time, you start to get a sense of how all of the sports are related to each other. We encourage you to ask yourself questions about the comparisons you saw. Did you notice any trends? How did the scores differ between team and individual sports? Between traditionally male- and female-dominated sports? Did any of the results surprise you? How will these insights change your perspective moving forward? "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 8 Conclusion 8.1 What we learned 8.2 Limitations 8.3 Future directions", " Chapter 8 Conclusion 8.1 What we learned We came into this project with an idea of how certain sports may be correlated with mental health outcomes. In our analyses, however, we found that these correlations are not as strong as we had thought. For example, we had expected that the critical nature of artistic sports like dance and gymnastics would result in more negative mental health responses among participants compares to goal-oriented sports like baseball or track, but the data shows that the type of sport did not have a strong connection to the mental health responses. In fact, the most noticeable difference in any calculated score was not found while faceting by sport, but by gender; the male athletes surveyed generally admitted to more risky behavior than the female athletes. Rather than be disappointed that we did not find strong correlations between sports and mental health, we can instead take a moment to recognize how personal experiences and biases may lead us to make predictions that do not align with the facts. 8.2 Limitations The initial survey contained nearly six hundred responses from each participant, so there was a lot of information; we had to make some decisions to decide which information to include and excluding in hopes of best answering our questions. As a result, we may have omitted responses that could have led to interesting insights if we had only asked questions targetting those variables. We also made a decision to focus on only those respondents participating in a university sports at the time of the survey. Each participant was instructed to indicate all of the sports they participated in, at what level, and when; but to bring consistency to our population, we considered on the primary sport of each participant at the time the survey was completed. If we had a larger population of respondents, we could have expanded the conversation to subset the responses by college vs. community vs. high school sport, responses of athletes who played for several years as opposed to a single year, responses of athletes who play multiple sports as opposed to one, and more. 8.3 Future directions A next step of this data analysis would be to analyze the mental health of a different population of athletes, namely professionals. While our data discussed responses of college students from a single university in the United States, asking the same questions of professional and analyzing the results could verify or challenge the conclusions we obtained here. We anticipate this being interesting because professional athletes likely consider their sport to be a much more significant part of their lives than college athletes, and the pressures of performing for income, fame, or prestigious titles may affect depression and anxiety rates, motivating reasons, and outlooks on success. Furthermore, expanding the study to include many participates of each type of sport across several demographics, countries, and ages could give additional insights into how different populations’ results vary among the different sub-populations. With more observations in each subset of the surveyed population, we could see which factors truly influence the correlations that are present.
