We were interested in how different segments of sport types (performative, competitive; team, individual; elite, amateur, etc.) correlated with mental health outcomes. In searching for datasets that had relevant information and data points, we found this survey data of Northeastern students that targeted athletes and non-athletes from 2006. The data includes survey results from 795 students on “how or if participation in sports affects their health-risk behavior”. Based on the data collected, we altered our questions and scope accordingly, ultimately coming to the following questions:

1. How are identification with sports and mental health correlated?

* How does this change with different standards of measuring identity as an athlete?
  * Ex. identifying as jock vs. athlete, or by response to SSQ03: “Sports are an important part of my life”
* How are perceived performance and mental health correlated?
  * Ex. responses to survey questions like “I am the best”
* How are perceived ambition and mental health correlated?
  * Ex. responses to survey questions like “I do my very best”
* How do certain sports appear to be correlated with self-destructive/dangerous behaviors?
  * Ex. driving while drunk/high, engaging in physical fights

2. How are individual/community connection to sports and mental health correlated?

* How does the correlation differ between sports that are typically performed individually (ex. golf, skiing), in small groups (ex. tennis), or in larger teams (ex. soccer)?
* How are responses to survey questions like “Friends are involved in sports” and “Depressed if I couldn’t compete in sports” correlated?

3. How are demographic information and mental health correlated for the student athletes?

* How does the correlation change in high school vs. college athletes? What about community athletes?
* How do mental health responses differ between male and female athletes? Between sports that are traditionally male- or female-dominated?
